## Ã‘ande Ru Tenonde: Encoder Forcing Algorithm Model to Multihead Neural Network decoder. (Novel architecture)
An encoder trained on both L1 and L2 to output the same vector into a low dimensional space, a novel approach to reduce the noise generated by the satellite. This ensures that L1 data is aligned with L2 data before going through the forward recurrent model with attention.
